Zaber revisited
Based on QNX4 driver for Wennberg Triple experiment.

Zaber introduces complexities because responses to commands may come out of sequence.
Each command may have a different timeout. We want to report if any command times out.
Timeouts were measured in seconds, and were checked when the same command was sent
to the same drive. Obviously we could improve on that.

This driver has an error reporting mechanism similar to report_err(), but the counts
are kept separately for each drive and each command. That allows problems with a
specific command to be made clear.

Each command type 

QNX6 Version

SerSelector, etc.

Should maintain a list of which drive/command queries are outstanding.
This could be sorted in timeout order, so the earliest timeout is first.
On timeout, report those errors.

Of course I could just handle it this way, only reporting timeouts when a
new command is requested.
